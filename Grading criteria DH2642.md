**DH2642 Intended Learning Outcomes:** Having passed the course, the student will be able to

* choose appropriate technical platforms or JavaScript frameworks to create **highly-useable *data-persistent*** interactive web applications or native applications  
* program interactive web applications according to **Model-View-Controller or related architectures**  
* program systems that read data from, and send data to, **web APIs** with good **user experience**  
* assess and **improve the usability** of existing interactive web applications  
* **cooperate** with others to implement interactive web applications.

Criteria below are for the **project grade**. Individual bonus applies on top of that. **Late projects can reach max grade C**	  
To get to grade X, then minimum X is required on **all** criteria (or max if max\<X for that criterion). **Aplus** on a criterion can compensate for small shortcomings in some other criterion. **UX Prize** gives extra bonus for well-designed and implemented user experience.

| **Architecture/code Separation of concerns:** Persistence of application state Application state (POJO model, Redux, Vuex, RxJS, Recoil, Mobx, Zustand…) Presenter View  Navigation concern  Keywords: Model-View-Presenter Model-view-controller **User-visible** third-party components  (router, promise resolver/suspense do **not** count) | **Bugs** that prevent application usage Application state spread out  in Views  All 4 concerns mixed (e.g. View native events save to persistence…) One single view of application state UI components access data via **global** scope/imports rather than props | Views with multiple responsibilities/roles (e.g. mix Sidebar and Summary in one component)  Multiple Views in a module (file) 3 **of** 4 concerns mixed  (e.g. [top-level state](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CtxiAG9mJ6kslSl6psBBlVDafFD4b2Rh2G7ft1GQ08o/edit#slide=id.g2082d434f04_27_32)) No Application state (e.g. Presenters connected directly  to Persistence)  | Views with multiple responsibilities/roles One module per View.  View-Presenter mix incidentally  Application State mixed with Persistence but separated  from Presenters and Views  | Application state separated  from all other concerns Views with separate and clear roles One module per View.   | None of the four main concerns mixed (Persistence, Application state , Presenter/Controller, View) Views with separate and clear roles. One module per View.  At least one **user-visible component written by others**   | None of the four main concerns mixed (Persistence, Application state , Presenter/Controller, View) Views with separate and clear roles. One module per View.  At least one **user-visible component written by others**   **State manager** (Redux, Recoil, Pinia, Zustand, Mobx **with actions**). All application state side effects (e.g. persistence) use the state manager **A plus:** Framework independent Redux mappings (connect) instead of custom hooks |

Satisfactory feedback on user actions Satisfactory visibility of system status Little user consultation at prototyping or formative evaluation stage Some  improvement based on usability feedback from users in the target group | Clear target group, clear benefits for the user Efficient task accomplishment Good feedback on user actions Good visibility of system status User feels in control. Moderate user satisfaction (pleasure of using the system) Documented user consultation, one 30 min session at prototyping **or** evaluation stage, documented improvements from user feedback | Clear target group, clear benefits for the user. Application functionality is easy to discover through exploration Efficient task accomplishment Very good feedback on user actions Very good visibility of system status User feels in control. Good user satisfaction (pleasure of using the system) Documented user consultation (30 min prototyping and 30 min formative evaluation, **or** 2x30min formative evaluation), with  documented improvements from user feedback | Clear target group, clear benefits for the user.  Application functionality is easy to discover through exploration Efficient task accomplishment.  Very good feedback on user actions Very good visibility of system status User feels in control.

| **Web APIs and Persistence**  Keywords: Single vs multiple data source App state persistence (e.g. Firebase) User authentication (e.g. Firebase) | Not using any remote data Application state not persisted at the server Users can see each other’s persisted data while (most cases) the application should keep it separate | Remote data is used from a single source, to make collections **and** summaries (**dinner planner in disguise**) Some system status shown when waiting for API requests Well separated persisted data, per **authenticated** user  | Remote data is used from a single source but no dinner model in disguise\! Create added value to users based on the data provided by the API Clear system status shown when waiting for API requests Well separated persisted data, per **authenticated** user   | Remote data is used from a single source, but no dinner planner in disguise\! Create added value to users based on the data provided by the API Clear system status shown when waiting for API requests and the user can choose to perform other actions while waiting for the response to arrive Well separated persisted data, per **authenticated** user  Persisted data increases usability (e.g. efficiency user doesn’t need to enter data again, users sees comparisons with other users’ averages etc)  **A plus:** live update of persistence. A user running multiple copies of the app sees the same data **A plus:** mashing-up data from several external sources/ APIs **A plus**: collaborative features on shared application state. User actions complement/help each other and user action conflicts are managed  |  |  |
| **Group cooperation** Keywords: Balance of work Role separation Individual self-reflection | Free riding, one or more persons do  all work and one does not do anything or very little (**contact project coach** ASAP) | Good balance of work in the group Some role separation in the group (per component or per concern: views, interaction, model…)  Work amount and roles documented through individual  self-reflections | Good balance of work in the group Role separation in the group (per component or per concern: views, interaction, model/application state…) Work amount and roles well documented in self-reflections  |  |  |  |
